def _mask_and_count(seq_x, seq_y, mask, order):
    """
    Apply binary mask to a pair of sequences & count most frequently jointly occurring windows

    This function does 3 things in the following sequence:
        1. Create sliding windows of a given size (order) - using zip and islice
        2. Apply a supplied mask to the sliding windows - using compress
        3. Count most frequently occurring window - using Counter

    In the NSRWS algorithm, this is the most time consuming step. Essentially expands
    two 1D sequences to a 2D sequence - where the sequences follows along row-wise &
    the columnar expansion encodes a sliding window for each row jointly from both
    sequences:
        1D sequences:
            (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
            (3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

        2D expansion for window order=3:
            (((1,3),(2,4),(3,5)),
             ((2,4),(3,5),(4,6)),
             ((3,5),(4,6),(5,7)),
             ((4,6),(5,7),(6,8)),
             ((5,7),(6,8),(7,9)))

        The mask is applied row-wise & must be of the same length as the number of rows
        in this 2D expansion. This is given by:
            len(mask) = len(seq) - (order - 1)

        Example application of the mask (1,0,0,1,1):
            1 -> (((1,3),(2,4),(3,5)),
            0 ->  ((2,4),(3,5),(4,6)),          (((1,3),(2,4),(3,5)),
            0 ->  ((3,5),(4,6),(5,7)),    --->   ((4,6),(5,7),(6,8)),
            1 ->  ((4,6),(5,7),(6,8)),           ((5,7),(6,8),(7,9)))
            1 ->  ((5,7),(6,8),(7,9)))

        Unique windows (rows of 2D expansion) are counted and most frequently occurring
        row is returned with counts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_x : array.array
        Discrete symbolic sequence containing 32-bit unsigned integers.
    seq_y : array.array
        Discrete symbolic sequence containing 32-bit unsigned integers.
    mask : array.array
        Collection of Booleans, where 0s indicate locations on "seq" to mask out.
        0s correspond to overlapping windows.
    order : int
        Size of window for NSRWS, 2 or greater.

    Returns
    -------
    pair_x : array.array
        Most frequently occurring non-overlapping "window" of size "order" in seq_x
    pair_y : array.array
        Most frequently occurring non-overlapping "window" of size "order" in seq_y
    count : int
        Number of times the most frequently occurring window occurs.

def _onestep_pairs(seq_x, seq_y, verbose=True):
    """
    Execute one full step of NSRPS (NSRWS with order=2) for a given sequence

    Makes use of 2 functions written in Cython & _mask_and_count in the following steps:
        1. Find overlapping pairs & store their indices for masking -> get_mask_pairs()
        2. Apply the mask and find most frequent pair -> _mask_and_count()
        3. Substitute all occurrences of the most frequent pair -> substitute_pairs()

    This function is different from _onestep_windows because:
        1. It is *much* faster due to fewer nested loops
        2. It targets a more common use case scenario: for distances, for CCC, etc
        3. For higher window orders, correctness needs to be proved outside of tests

    The implementation will benefit from:
        1. Decorators for timing
        2. Decorators for verbosity of output
        3. Cython implementation of the slowest part: _mask_and_count
            problem: counting windows in C?
