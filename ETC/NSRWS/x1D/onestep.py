def _mask_and_count(seq, mask, order):
    """
    Apply binary mask to a sequence and count most frequently occurring windows

    This function does 3 things in the following sequence:
        1. Create sliding windows of a given size (order) - using zip and islice
        2. Apply a supplied mask to the sliding windows - using compress
        3. Count most frequently occurring window - using Counter

    In the NSRWS algorithm, this is the most time consuming step. Essentially expands
    a 1D sequence to a 2D sequence - where the sequence follows row-wise & the columnar
    expansion encodes a sliding window for each row:
        1D sequence:
            (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

        2D expansion for window order=3:
            ((1,2,3),
             (2,3,4),
             (3,4,5),
             (4,5,6),
             (5,6,7))

        The mask is applied row-wise & must be of the same length as the number of rows
        in this 2D expansion. This is given by:
            len(mask) = len(seq) - (order - 1)

        Example application of the mask (1,0,0,1,1):
            1 -> ((1,2,3),
            0 ->  (2,3,4),    ---->      ((1,2,3),
            0 ->  (3,4,5),                (4,5,6),
            1 ->  (4,5,6),                (5,6,7))
            1 ->  (5,6,7))

        Unique windows (rows of 2D expansion) are counted and most frequently occurring
        row is returned with counts.

        1D sequence with overlap:
            (1,1,1,1,1,2,1)

        2D expansion for window order=3:
            ((1,1,1),
             (1,1,1),    ----> overlap
             (1,1,1),    ----> overlap
             (1,1,2),
             (1,2,1))

        mask will be (1,0,0,1,1) and its application will yield:
            ((1,1,1),
             (1,1,2),
             (1,2,1))

        Here, each window occurs once and the first one is returned -> (1,1,1)

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : array.array
        Discrete symbolic sequence containing 32-bit unsigned integers.
    mask : array.array
        Collection of Booleans, where 0s indicate locations on "seq" to mask out.
        0s correspond to overlapping windows.
    order : int
        Size of window for NSRWS, 2 or greater.

    Returns
    -------
    freq_window : array.array
        Most frequently occurring non-overlapping "window" of size "order".
    count : int
        Number of times the most frequently occurring window occurs.

    Execute one full step of NSRPS (NSRWS with order=2) for a given sequence

    Makes use of 2 functions written in Cython & _mask_and_count in the following steps:
        1. Find overlapping pairs & store their indices for masking -> get_mask_pairs()
        2. Apply the mask and find most frequent pair -> _mask_and_count()
        3. Substitute all occurrences of the most frequent pair -> substitute_pairs()

    This function is different from _onestep_windows because:
        1. It is *much* faster due to fewer nested loops
        2. It targets a more common use case scenario: for distances, for CCC, etc
        3. For higher window orders, correctness needs to be proved outside of tests

    The implementation will benefit from:
        1. Decorators for timing
